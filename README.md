The codebase for Team 18 during RBE 3001: Unified Robotics III at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The MATLAB code is the culmination of five labs and seven weeks of hard work to properly control a 3-DOF robotic arm to manipulate colored balls. Ultimately serves as a pick and place system for these four distinctly colored balls using computer vision and principles of robotics learned in this course, such as: forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, trajectory generation, and computer vision. See the final demonstration video listed in the Documenation section.

As this course was already completed as of mid-October 2021, this repository will not be updated other than documentation purposes.

Team 18: Brian Shin, William Stanley, Nicholas Hom.
